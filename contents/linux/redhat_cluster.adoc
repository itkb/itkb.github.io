= Deploy new version

First of all let's check if the edit is ok:

[source, bash]
ccs_config_validate -f /root/cluster.conf

Then copy it to the right location

[source, bash]
cp /root/cluster.conf /etc/cluster/cluster.conf

Then propagate

[source, bash]
cman_tool version -r

= Check if the new version has been propagated properly

To check the current version of the cluster on a specific machine, run:

[source, bash]
head -2 /etc/cluster/cluster.conf | tail -1 | sed -r 's/.*"([0-9]+)".*/\1/'
